# AgentGov — AI Agent Governance Platform

> AgentGov is the only platform that combines AI observability with EU AI Act compliance in one solution. Monitor, secure, and govern your AI agents with real-time tracing, risk classification, and compliance documentation.

## What AgentGov Does

AgentGov provides two core capabilities:

1. **AI Observability** — Real-time tracing of AI agent executions, comparable to tools like Langfuse and LangSmith
2. **Regulatory Compliance** — EU AI Act compliance features including risk classification, documentation generation, and incident tracking

These are unified in a single platform so teams don't need separate tools for monitoring and compliance.

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### Tracing & Observability

- **Full Trace Capture**: Every LLM call, tool use, and agent step is recorded with input/output, latency, and cost
- **Span Hierarchy**: Traces contain spans organized in a parent-child tree, showing exact execution flow
- **Timeline View**: Gantt-style timeline visualization showing parallel and sequential execution
- **Tree View**: Hierarchical view of agent execution with expandable nodes
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live updates — see traces as they execute
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-model, per-project, and per-user cost analytics in USD
- **Token Counting**: Automatic token usage tracking for all supported models

### EU AI Act Compliance

- **Risk Classification**: Classify AI systems using Annex III categories (Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal)
- **Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)**: Generate FRIA reports for high-risk AI systems
- **Technical Documentation**: Auto-generate Article 11 technical documentation templates
- **Incident Tracking**: Log and manage AI incidents with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Human Oversight**: Configure human-in-the-loop requirements per AI system
- **Compliance Obligations**: Track which EU AI Act articles apply to each system
- **Audit Export**: Export compliance data for external auditors

### Workspace & Team Management

- **Multi-Project Workspaces**: Isolated environments with separate API keys per project
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Owner, Admin, and Member roles with fine-grained permissions
- **Team Invitations**: Email-based invitations with role assignment
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based 2FA for account security
- **API Key Management**: Hashed API keys with IP allowlisting support

## SDK — @agentgov/sdk

The SDK is published on npm as `@agentgov/sdk`. It has zero dependencies and is under 100 lines of code.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @agentgov/sdk
```

### OpenAI Integration

```typescript
import { AgentGov } from '@agentgov/sdk'
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const ag = new AgentGov({ apiKey: process.env.AGENTGOV_API_KEY })
const openai = ag.wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI())

// All calls are now automatically traced
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
})
```

### Vercel AI SDK Integration

```typescript
import { AgentGov } from '@agentgov/sdk'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { generateText } from 'ai'

const ag = new AgentGov({ apiKey: process.env.AGENTGOV_API_KEY })

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4'),
  prompt: 'Hello',
  experimental_telemetry: ag.telemetryConfig(),
})
```

### REST API

For custom integrations, use the REST API directly:

- `POST /v1/traces` — Create a trace
- `POST /v1/spans` — Create a span within a trace
- `GET /v1/traces` — List traces with filtering and pagination
- `GET /v1/traces/:id` — Get trace details with all spans

All endpoints require an `x-api-key` header with your project API key.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, React 18, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Fastify with Zod validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for query caching and background jobs
- **Auth**: API keys (hashed with SHA-256) for SDK, NextAuth.js for dashboard
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), any Node.js host (API)

## Data Model

- **Project**: Tenant workspace with its own API key, team members, and settings
- **Trace**: Complete agent execution from start to finish, containing multiple spans
- **Span**: Single operation within a trace — can be an LLM call, tool call, or agent step
- **AI System**: Registered AI system for EU AI Act compliance tracking
- **Incident**: Logged AI incident with severity, description, and resolution status
